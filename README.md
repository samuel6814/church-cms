# WIS-CMS

**Wesleyan International Society Church Management System** — a full-stack web application for The Methodist Church Ghana — Wesleyan International Society.

WIS-CMS replaces paper-based church administration with a secure, branch-scoped platform for member records, visitors, departments, and (planned) attendance, finance, and communications.

## About

Built as a pro bono project for a congregation of approximately 800–1,000 members. The system is designed for a single branch today, with UUID-based models and branch scoping on the API to support growth.

---

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Laravel 13, PHP 8.3+ |
| Frontend | React 19, React Router 7, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (recommended) or SQLite for quick trials |
| Auth | Laravel Sanctum (Bearer token) |
| RBAC | [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) |
| Audit | [spatie/laravel-activitylog](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-activitylog) |
| PDF / Excel | DomPDF, OpenSpout (dependencies installed; features pending) |
| Containers | Docker Compose (PostgreSQL) |

---

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.3+ with extensions required by Laravel (`mbstring`, `pdo`, `openssl`, etc.)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for PostgreSQL)

---

## Local development

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wis-cms.git
cd wis-cms

composer install
npm install
```

### 2. Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure the database. **PostgreSQL** (matches `docker-compose.yml`):

```env
APP_NAME="WIS-CMS"
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5433
DB_DATABASE=wis_cms
DB_USERNAME=wis_admin
DB_PASSWORD=wis_secret_2024
```

Start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For a quick trial without Docker, you can use SQLite (`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` and `DB_DATABASE` pointing at `database/database.sqlite`).

### 3. Migrate and seed

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Seeders create:

- Default branch (Wesleyan International Society, Kumasi)
- Roles and permissions (six roles)
- Service types and finance categories
- Super admin user (see below)

### 4. Run the app

**Option A — all services (recommended)**

```bash
composer dev
```

Runs Laravel (`:8000`), queue worker, log tail (Pail), and Vite (`:3000`) together.

**Option B — separate terminals**

```bash
php artisan serve          # http://127.0.0.1:8000
npm run dev                # Vite dev server on :3000
```

Open the app at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**. The React SPA is served through Laravel; API requests go to `/api`.

### One-command setup

After cloning and copying `.env` (with database configured):

```bash
composer setup
```

Runs `composer install`, generates the app key, migrates, `npm install`, and builds frontend assets.

---

## Default login

After seeding, sign in with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `admin@wis-cms.local` |
| Password | `Admin@12345` |

Change this password before any production deployment.

---

## User roles

| Role | Slug | Typical access |
|------|------|----------------|
| Super Admin | `super_admin` | Full system access |
| Pastor | `pastor` | Read-mostly across modules, exports |
| Secretary | `secretary` | Members, visitors, attendance, departments, messaging |
| Finance Officer | `finance_officer` | Finance transactions and reports |
| Department Leader | `department_leader` | Department membership and attendance |
| Usher | `usher` | Attendance capture |

Permissions are defined in `database/seeders/RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php`.

## API overview

Base URL: `/api`

### Public

|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Obtain Bearer token |

### Authenticated (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Revoke current token |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Current user, roles, permissions |
| `POST` | `/auth/change-password` | Update password |
| `GET` | `/dashboard` | Dashboard stats (stub) |
| `*` | `/members`, `/members/stats` | Member CRUD and statistics |
| `*` | `/visitors`, `/visitors/stats` | Visitor CRUD and statistics |
| `*` | `/departments`, `/departments/stats` | Department CRUD and statistics |
| `GET` | `/departments/{id}/members` | List department members |
| `POST` | `/departments/{id}/members` | Add member to department |
| `DELETE` | `/departments/{id}/members/{memberId}` | Remove member |

List endpoints support query parameters such as `search`, `status`, `gender`, `page`, and `per_page` where applicable. All data is scoped to the authenticated user's `branch_id`.

---

## Frontend routes

| Path | Page |
|------|------|
| `/login` | Sign in |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard |
| `/members`, `/members/new`, `/members/:id/edit` | Members |
| `/visitors`, `/visitors/new`, `/visitors/:id/edit` | Visitors |
| `/departments`, `/departments/new`, `/departments/:id`, `/departments/:id/edit` | Departments |

Sidebar links for attendance, finance, and messages are placeholders until those modules are implemented.

---

## Testing

```bash
composer test
# or
php artisan test
```

---

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

Serve the application with a proper web server (nginx, Apache, or Laravel Forge) pointing the document root at `public/`.

---

## Environment variables (reference)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `APP_URL` | Application URL (used for links and Sanctum) |
| `DB_*` | Database connection (use `pgsql` in production) |
| `VITE_APP_NAME` | Frontend app title |

SMS (Arkesel) and mail settings will be added when the communication module is implemented.

---

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Follow existing patterns: Form Requests, API Resources, branch scoping, activity logging.
3. Run `php artisan test` and ensure the app loads at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` before opening a pull request.
